# japanese-assistant

AIChan is an AI assistant for learners of Japanese. It utilizes the ChatGPT api to allow for a range of features that are not possible with other tools.

## Key features include: ## 
1. Replacing dropped particles (どこ行くの？ → どこに行くの？) 
2. Expanding contractions (やらなきゃ → やらなければいけない)
3. Smart translation (translates the text to English and specifies any aspects of the original that may not be clear from the translation)
4. Correcting understanding (compares the original to your translation and explains what you may be misunderstanding).

*Note: AIChan is currently just a demo - I hope to eventually develop it further into a fully functional tool.*
