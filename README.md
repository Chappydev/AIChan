# japanese-assistant

AIChan is an AI assistant for learners of Japanese. It utilizes the ChatGPT api to allow for a range of features that are not possible with other tools.

## Key features include: ## 
1. Replacing dropped particles (どこ行くの？ → どこに行くの？) 
2. Expanding contractions (やらなきゃ → やらなければいけない)
3. Smart translation (translates the text to English and specifies any aspects of the original that may not be clear from the translation)
4. Correcting understanding (compares the original to your translation and explains what you may be misunderstanding).

## Video Player ##
AIChan now includes a 'video' page where you can load in a video file and a corresponding subtitle file, and use AIChan on the subtitles. This means you can begin using AIChan in your immersion workflow. 

## Bugs and Stuff ##
As AIChan is very new, there will likely be bugs or helpful features missing. If you come across any unexpected behaviour, please make a detailed description of the issue on github, and/or contact me directly. I will make an effort to review these as they come.
